#### Imposter syndrome and growth mindset
````text
- What strategies would be helpful for you for combating imposter syndrome and stereotype threat in your life?

    I believe that it's a normal or at least a very common feeling being overwhelmed 
    when you start a new project or in a new team. 
    For me, the best thing to do about that is to get my hands dirty on the work doing a lot of research 
    in order to put my mind focus in the job to drop that feeling even not being aware of it.

- What are some advantages of a growth mindset over a fixed mindset?
 
    I personally think that the main advantage of the growth mindset is 
    that you already have that feeling that if you work hard enough, 
    you can overcome all the difficulties, you can overcome whatever you want.
