## Planning your narrative

#### choose a project you'd like to practice describing. 
```text
I would like to describe the last project I was working on.
It was a web project at the Fuenlabrada city council.
```

#### Identify the four main components of the STAR approach for the project you picked. 
#### STAR stands for "Situation, Task, Action, Result".
```text
- Situation: In my last project at the Fuenlabrada city council I had to design and 
develop a web project. The project was about the development and construction 
of the management and telephony system of the Fuenlabrada town hall.

- Task: They maintained a very old application for the management and telephony system.
I had to remove the old application and start from scratch the new one in order to fix the data,
make reports, user access control, devices control, phone lines control and audit billing.

- Action: First I had to decide the tools I wanted to work with, second I had to do a data 
migration from the old database system to the new one, create a system access with user profiles,
create a friendly interface in order to insert, update and delete data, integrate a tool in order
to make reports.

- Result: The result was an awesome application web, agile, easy to understand for a non technical user.

#### Describe your work
```text
- Interviewer: So, can you tell me a little bit about a project that you worked on?
- Me: Yeah! I would love that! Let me tell you about a project at the Fuenlabrada city council.
      It was my last project I've worked on.
The objective of this project was about the development and construction 
of the management and telephony system of the Fuenlabrada town hall.

- Interviewer: Ok, sounds good and What does do this application?
- Me: The city council lends telephones with associated lines to its employees. 
The city council has many employees at its service, and they wanted to control 
the devices and the cost of the telephone lines, because the telephone bill had grown a lot in recent years. 
They wanted to control their employees' spending on telephony, 
but they also wanted to be able to compare the phones and lines that they had registered with 
the bill that the service provider send them every month.
They don't trust the bill the phone company send them. 

- Interviewer: So, How did you do this? did they already have the users, 
the phones and the lines registered in some way? 
- Me: They maintained a very old application for the management and telephony system in a
Microsoft Access Database. There was a lot of redundant data and they were crushing the data history.
They only had one table in the database, with fifty or sixty fields more or less.

Interviewer: Wow!!! What a distressing situation, I think.
Me: Yeah!!! This was the hard part, the creation of a new relational data model from the old model
in order to preserve their data, because they demanded that.
I had to spend a month to build the new relational data model. I had to talk with the application's users
in order to understand the meaning of the data. Finally I created the relational data model then I had to do
the data migration. I spent another whole month doing the data migration because I couldn't automate the 
process entirely, so I had to do some parts manually.
The old model was a Microsoft Access Database and the new model was an Oracle Database.
The problem with the migration was with the table relationship because I had to do that part manually.
Once I had the data model the rest of the application was a piece of cake, 
but I had a lot of work ahead because I was alone.
I used Java with Jsp and Javascript to build the application. Hibernate and JPA to map the data model in order
to do the inserts, updates and deletes fast. I had to integrate the application with a LDAP server or 
Active Directory for the user authentication and make a report tool into the application. 
The result was great, now they have a web application and they can manage the data fast and safe, they can 
do reports and compare their data with the data of the service provider. They have already fixed a lot of errors and
saved money.

Interviewer: Oh! That is wonderful. Well, that's all, thanks for your time.
Me: Thanks for having me, goodbye.
