# Mastering the Software Engineering Interview
```text
You’ve hit a major milestone as a computer scientist and are becoming 
a capable programmer. 
You now know how to solve problems, write algorithms, and analyze solutions; 
and you have a wealth of tools (like data structures) at your disposal.  
You may now be ready for an internship or (possibly) an entry-level 
software engineering job.  But can you land the internship/job?  
It depends in part on how well you can solve new technical problems 
and communicate during interviews.  How can you get better at this?  
Practice!  

With the support of Google’s recruiting and engineering teams we’ve provided tips, 
examples, and practice opportunities in this course that may help you 
with a number of tech companies.  
We’ll assist you to organize into teams to practice.  
Lastly, we’ll give you basic job search advice, and tips for succeeding 
once you’re on the job.
