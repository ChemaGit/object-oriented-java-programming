# YOUR EXPERIENCE

#### Have you had a negative interview experience?  Who forms your support network to turn to for help and advice?

A couple of years ago I had a rough interview. 
I thought that the offer  was about Big Data and the company wanted a Javascript master, 
I suppose I missed something in the phone call the day before 
the in person-interview or my resume wasn't clear enough about my skills, 
because, indeed I did a few things in Javascript, but I'm not proficiency. 
So the interviewer started to ask me some questions about 
regular expressions in Javascript, graph algorithms in Javascript, so on and so forth. 
So I didn't how to answer all the questions, even a few of them. 
I know the interviewer,for his face expressions, was thinking, 
what a waste of time with this guy! and I was really nervous. 
It was a really bad experience, but I have my wife who told me, be calm, 
relax and in the future you will have more opportunities, 
and try to learn from your own mistakes.

#### What's been your proudest interview moment?

A year ago more or less I applied for a Big Data job. 
We had a phone call and everything was good. 
The interview day came  and that day in particular I was really confident on myself. 
They asked me a lot of questions about databases, sql, java, 
and I had to resolve a few quite hard problems on paper in java and sql, 
but I did it very well. Finally, they hired me.
