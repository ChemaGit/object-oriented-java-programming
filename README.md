# Object Oriented Java Programming: Data Structures and Beyond Specialization
## Offered By UC San Diego (University of California San Diego)

https://www.coursera.org/specializations/java-object-oriented

````text
This Specialization covers intermediate topics in software development. 
You’ll learn object-oriented programming principles that will allow you to use Java to its full potential, 
and you’ll implement data structures and algorithms for organizing large amounts 
of data in a way that is both efficient and easy to work with. 
You’ll also practice critically evaluating your own code, 
and you’ll build technical communication skills that will help you prepare 
for job interviews and collaborative work as a software engineer. 
In the final Capstone Project, you’ll apply your skills to analyze data collected from a real-world (social) network. 
Google has contributed real-world projects and the involvement of its engineers as guest lecturers to these courses.

### Course 1: Object Oriented Programming in Java

### Course 2: Data Structures and Performance
````text
How do Java programs deal with vast quantities of data? Many of the data structures and algorithms that work 
with introductory toy examples break when applications process real, large data sets.  
Efficiency is critical, but how do we achieve it, and how do we even measure it?

In this course, you will use and analyze data structures that are used in industry-level applications, such as linked lists, trees, and hashtables.  
You will explain how these data structures make programs more efficient and flexible.  
You will apply asymptotic Big-O analysis to describe the performance of algorithms and evaluate which strategy to use for efficient data retrieval, 
addition of new data, deletion of elements, and/or memory usage.

The program you will build throughout this course allows its user to manage, manipulate and reason about large sets of textual data.

### Course 3: Advanced Data Structures in Java

How does Google Maps plan the best route for getting around town given current traffic conditions?  
How does an internet router forward packets of network traffic to minimize delay?  
How does an aid group allocate resources to its affiliated local partners?

To solve such problems, we first represent the key pieces of data in a complex data structure. 
In this course, you’ll learn about data structures, like graphs, that are fundamental for working with structured real world data.  
You will develop, implement, and analyze algorithms for working with this data to solve real world problems. 
In addition, as the programs you develop in this course become more complex, 
we’ll examine what makes for good code and class hierarchy design so that you can not only write correct code, 
but also share it with other people and maintain it in the future.

The backbone project in this course will be a route planning application. 
You will apply the concepts from each Module directly to building an application 
that allows an autonomous agent (or a human driver!) to navigate its environment.  
And as usual we have our different video series to help tie the content back to its importance 
in the real world and to provide tiered levels of support to meet your personal needs.
