This Specialization covers intermediate topics in software development. You’ll learn object-oriented programming principles that will allow you to use Java to its full potential, and you’ll implement data structures and algorithms for organizing large amounts of data in a way that is both efficient and easy to work with. You’ll also practice critically evaluating your own code, and you’ll build technical communication skills that will help you prepare for job interviews and collaborative work as a software engineer. In the final Capstone Project, you’ll apply your skills to analyze data collected from a real-world (social) network. Google has contributed real-world projects and the involvement of its engineers as guest lecturers to these courses.

Course 1: Object Oriented Programming in Java

Course 2: Data Structures and Performance

How do Java programs deal with vast quantities of data? Many of the data structures and algorithms that work with introductory toy examples break when applications process real, large data sets.  Efficiency is critical, but how do we achieve it, and how do we even measure it?

In this course, you will use and analyze data structures that are used in industry-level applications, such as linked lists, trees, and hashtables.  You will explain how these data structures make programs more efficient and flexible.  You will apply asymptotic Big-O analysis to describe the performance of algorithms and evaluate which strategy to use for efficient data retrieval, addition of new data, deletion of elements, and/or memory usage.

The program you will build throughout this course allows its user to manage, manipulate and reason about large sets of textual data. 

Course 3: Advanced Data Structures in Java

Course 4: Mastering the Software Engineering Interview

Course 5: Capstone: Analyzing (Social) Network Data
