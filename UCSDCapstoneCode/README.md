# Capstone: Analyzing (Social) Network Data
````text
In this capstone project we’ll combine  all of the skills from all four specialization courses 
to do something really fun: analyze social networks!  

The opportunities for learning are practically endless in a social network.  
Who are the “influential” members of the network?  
What are the sub-communities in the network?   
Who is connected to whom, and by how many links?   
These are just some of the questions you can explore in this project.

We will provide you with a real-world data set and some infrastructure for getting started, 
as well as some warm up tasks and basic project requirements, 
but then it’ll be up to you where you want to take the project.  
If you’re running short on ideas, we’ll have several suggested directions 
that can help get your creativity and imagination going.  
Finally, to integrate the skills you acquired in course 4 (and to show off your project!) 
you will be asked to create a video showcase of your final product.
