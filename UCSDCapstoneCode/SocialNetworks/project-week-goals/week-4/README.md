# Capstone: Full project checkpoint.
````text
In this assignment you should submit a rich text document containing a report on your progress 
toward completing your capstone assignment.  
This progress report should contain the following sections 
(note that it's perfectly acceptable to copy and paste content from previous weeks' assignments, 
but be sure to make any changes necessary based on any peer feedback you received or any changes 
in the scope or focus of your project):
````

#### 1. Overview
````text
In one sentence, give an overview summarizing your project.
````

#### 2. Data
````text
Briefly describe the data set you are using including the same details 
about the data you included in your project proposal in week 2.
````

#### 3. Questions
````text
State the two (or more) questions you are investigating using this data set.
````

#### 4. Algorithms and Data Structures progress
````text
Give the algorithm(s) and data structures you are implementing to answer your questions.  
In a few sentences describe how you believe the algorithm(s) will allow you to address your questions.   
In another paragraph give a status report on your implementation including what 
you have done and what you believe remains.
````

#### 5. Code Overview
````text
Describe each of the classes you created or plan to create to support your graph and algorithms.    
For each class include a few sentences about the purpose of the class and how it helps store the data required.  
Make clear your progress on your implementation of each class.  
After your description of your classes, provide a brief justification (1 paragraph, 4-6 sentences) 
for your overall design.  
We have provided a template for this section below.  
You do not have to have your class design completely nailed down and it's OK 
for your classes to change between now and your final submission.

Class name: [INSERT CLASS NAME HERE]

Purpose and description of class:

Class name: [INSERT NEXT CLASS NAME HERE]

Purpose and description of class:

Overall Design Justification (4-6 sentences): 
````

#### 6. Testing Plan
````text
Describe how you plan to test your implementation.  
Be ask specific as possible about what test cases you will create and use and how 
you will verify that your algorithms work correctly.
````

#### 7. Reflection so far
````text
Have you had to change your project or its scope since your first proposal?  
What caused you to do so?
