# Week 2: Project scope and definition
````text
In this second week you will define the scope of your project.  
This assignment will involve selecting a data set, 
determining what questions you will ask about your data, 
finding or developing the data structures and algorithms to answer those questions, 
and doing a preliminary analysis of the running time of these algorithms.

#### Project ideas
````text
Your assignment this week is to propose a project that you will complete for your capstone project. 
In this assignment you will define the scope of your capstone project.  
You will submit a rich text document that defines the data set you will use, 
the questions you will investigate, and the algorithms and data structures 
you will use to investigate these questions, including an analysis of the appropriateness 
and limitations of these algorithms.  The structure of the report should be as follows; 
make sure to use the section headers given by the bold text below:

- Overview
    In one sentence, give an overview summarizing your project

- Data 
    In this section you will describe the data set you will use. 
    You should select a real-world social network data set to work with. 
    This set can be any data you choose but it must be real-world.  
    There are several tools for extracting your own data from social network sites
    and you are encouraged to use data that is personally relevant to you.  
    Here are a couple we know about:
    * Obtain your twitter archive: 
        https://support.twitter.com/articles/20170160?lang=en#
    * Extract your Facebook data with this tool: 
        https://socialnetimporter.codeplex.com/  
    
    Note that we have not tried this tool, so let us know how it goes.
    
    Post other tools you find for extracting social network data in the discussion 
    forum and we'll update the list above!  
    You may also use the data we provided in the week 1 warmup assignment, 
    or some version of it that you extract 
    (for example, the Egonet resulting from a particularly interesting center you choose).
    
    Once you have selected your data set, you should include the following information in your report:

    * Overview of the data you will use--What is this data?  Where did it come from?
    * Link to where you obtained the data (if appropriate and public), 
        or a description of how you extracted it.
    * Details of the data set: 
        How will you represent this data as a graph?  
        How many nodes and edges (approximately) are in the data? 

- Questions

    List at least two questions that you will explore using the data set.  
    You should explicitly tag one question as the "easy" question that you 
    will explore first and use to complete the assignment in week 3.  This 
    should be a question you can write an algorithm to explore in less than a
     week.  Roughly, the scope of the "easy" question should be similar 
    to the methods you wrote as the warm-up assignment in week 1.

- Algorithms and Data Structures

    For each question, list the algorithm(s) and additional  data 
    structures, if any, you will use to answer this question.  Explain in a 
    few sentences how these algorithms will allow you or the user of your 
    program to explore or answer each question.

- Algorithm Analysis, Limitations and Risks

    This section covers the information Mia discussed in her last video.  
    We want you to think about the power of the algorithms you selected for the questions 
    you are asking, and identify any risks or issues early.

    Select the algorithm(s) you proposed for your "harder" question and give
     its running time in terms of the number of vertices and edges in your 
    graph.  It is perfectly OK to look up this running time assuming you are
     using an algorithm that you have found in a book or online.   

    Then,  you should also discuss the limitations and risks of your algorithm(s).   For 
    example, if your algorithm is exponential because your problem is 
    NP-complete, consider whether it will be practical for the dataset you have.  
    You will want to explore approximation algorithms to work on the size of 
    your data.  Or if your proposed algorithm is already an approximation, 
    discuss under what conditions it is likely to perform well or not.  If 
    there are no limitations that you identify, state that and give a brief justification for why not. 

    Finally, discuss one or more additional risks to your completion of the project 
    in general that might prevent you from finishing your project successfully.  
    E.g., do you not have your data yet or not understand its format?  
    Do you need a data structure that you've never used before and will have to implement?  
    Do you anticipate that it will be difficult to assure the correctness of your algorithms and code?  
    We expect that everyone will report at least one additional risk in this section.

- Review criteria

    In this assignment you will receive feedback on your project scope.
    
    Your final score on this assignment will be the median score you receive 
    from your peers, but what you might find most useful is the open-ended 
    comments that they provide in their review. Because of this, please make sure 
    you give thoughtful and complete feedback when reviewing others.

    Before you start your review for any one submission, 
    you probably want to take a look at several submissions. 
    This can also help give you ideas for your own project scope.

    Most importantly, don't be afraid to suggest improvements, but do so in a 
    constructive and supportive way. Learners will take your feedback very seriously 
    in helping to define the scope of their project, so make sure you think carefully 
    about your feedback and be courteous and respectful in your response.

    Please note that all open-ended feedback should be given in English.

- The Peer Review Process

    You will be asked to provide feedback on learners' submitted project scope documents 
    in each of the areas you were asked to write about in your project.
    
    When you provide your review, you should provide open-ended feedback to give
     specific comments on any of the aspects from the rubric questions. It 
    is this open-ended feedback that will be most valuable to you and other 
    learners.  We all appreciate your attention to detail in this peer review assignment.
