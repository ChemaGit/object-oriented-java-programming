# Capstone implementation: Mini-project
````text
This assignment is a mini-version of your full project submission.  
It is not required, but it gives you a chance to practice the final submission and get some feedback 
that will help you ensure that you will pass the final assignment.

As usual, before you complete this assignment, we encourage you to do a few peer reviews to
 see what other people have done.  This will help you understand the 
review criteria and you might even choose to make some changes to your 
code based on your reviews of others' code.  See the instructions for 
peer reviewing under the Review Criteria section below.

To complete this assignment you need to finish your exploration of your first "easier" question about your data.  
Then, produce and submit the following documents:
````

#### Submission prompt 1: Overview document
````text
Submit a rich text document that contains the following sections, 
whose contents in the first four sections should be similar (though not always identical) 
to the subset of what you submitted for week 2's assignment 
(though make sure you make any updates if the scope of your project has changed).

1. Overview: In one sentence, give an overview summarizing your project.

2. Data: Briefly describe the data set you are using including the same details 
   about the data you included in last week's assignment.

3. Questions: Give the "easier" question you investigated using this data set.

4. Algorithms, Data Structures, and Answer to your Question: Give the algorithm(s) 
   and data structures you implemented and used.  In a few sentences
   describe how the algorithm(s) you implemented and the code you wrote allowed you to answer the question you listed.  
   Also include the answer to the question you asked on the data set you analyzed.  

5. Algorithm analysis: State and justify the running time of your algorithm.  
   If you did not include detailed code or pseudocode in your answer to part 4 which you are analyzing here, 
   you should include code or pseudocode here on which you will do your analysis. Unlike in the project proposal, 
   here we want you to actually trace through code or pseudocode to justify the Big-O running time, 
   like you did in Course 2, Week 2, Lesson 2: 

   https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-structures-optimizing-performance/home/week/2

6. Correctness verification (i.e. testing):  In about a paragraph, 
   describe how you verified that your program worked as expected.  
   Describe your overall testing approach as well as the specific 
   tests you developed and the edge cases you considered.   
   If it is more natural to put this information in a bulletted list, please do so.

7. Reflection: How did your project focus change since your project proposal, if at all?  
   What caused these changes?

#### Submission prompt 2: Code overview 
````text
Submit a second rich text document in which you describe each of 
the classes you created to support your graph and algorithm.    For 
each class include a few sentences about the purpose of the class and 
how it helps store the data required.  After your description of your 
classes, provide a brief justification (1 paragraph, 4-6 sentences) for 
your overall design.  We have provided a template for this section here:

Class name: [INSERT CLASS NAME HERE]

Purpose and description of class:

Class name: [INSERT NEXT CLASS NAME HERE]

Purpose and description of class:

... 

Overall Design Justification (4-6 sentences): 
````

#### Submission Prompt 3: Your code
````text
Make sure you have sufficient comments in your code so that your peer reviewer can understand what you have done.  
Then create and submit a zip file containing all of the code that you wrote for this part of the project 
(which should include all of the classes you discussed in your overview document).  
The reviewer's goal is not to run your code, but rather to look at it and provide a review of its structure.  
You do NOT need to upload your data.
