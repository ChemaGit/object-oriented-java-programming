# Capstone: Full Project Report
````text
To complete this assignment you need to finish your exploration of both of your questions about your data, 
including writing all code.  Then, produce and submit the following documents:
````

## Overview document
````text
Submit a rich text document that contains the following sections, whose 
contents in the first four sections should be similar (though not always identical) to the subset of 
what you submitted for week 2's assignment (though make sure you make 
any updates if the scope of your project has changed).
````

#### Overview
````text
In one sentence, give an overview summarizing your project.
````

#### Data
````text
Briefly describe the data set you are using including the same details about the data you included in your project proposal in week 2.
````

#### Questions
````text
State the two (or more) questions you investigated using this data set.
````

#### Algorithms, Data Structures, and Answer to your Question
````text
Give the algorithms and data structures you implemented and used. 
In a few sentences describe how the algorithms you implemented and the code you wrote 
allowed you to answer the question you listed.  
Also include the answers  to the questions you asked on the data set you analyzed.  
````

#### Algorithm analysis
````text
State and justify the running time of at least your main algorithm.  
If you did not include detailed code or pseudocode in your answer to part 4 which you are analyzing here, 
you should include code or pseudocode here on which you will do your 
analysis. Unlike in the project proposal, here we want you to actually 
trace through code or pseudocode to justify the Big-O running time.
You should include an analysis of at least the code/algorithm you used to answer the "harder" 
question you asked, but you may also include an analysis of other parts of your code/algorithms if you want.  
````

#### Correctness verification (i.e. testing)
````text
In 1-3 paragraphs, describe how you verified that your program worked as 
expected.  Describe your overall testing approach as well as the 
specific tests you developed and the edge cases you considered.   
If it is more natural to put this information in a bulletted list, please do so.
````

#### Reflection
````text
How did your focus change since your project proposal, if at all?  What caused these changes?
````

## Code overview 
````text
Describe each of the classes you created or plan to create to support your graph and algorithms.    
For each class include a few sentences about the purpose of the class and how it helps store the data required.  
Make clear your progress on your implementation of each class.  
After your description of your classes, provide a brief justification (1 paragraph, 4-6 sentences) 
for your overall design.  
We have provided a template for this section below.  
You do not have to have your class design completely nailed down and it's OK 
for your classes to change between now and your final submission.

Class name: [INSERT CLASS NAME HERE]

Purpose and description of class:

Class name: [INSERT NEXT CLASS NAME HERE]

Purpose and description of class:

... 

Overall Design Justification (4-6 sentences): 
````

## Your code
````text
Make sure you have sufficient comments in your code so that your peer reviewer can understand what you have done.  
Then create and submit a zip file containing all of the code that you wrote for your entire project 
(which should include all of the classes you discussed in your overview document).  
The reviewer's goal is not to run your code, but rather to look at it and provide a review of its structure.  
You do NOT need to upload your data.
