# GRAPHS

## Explain when the Graph abstract data type (ADT) is useful
## Compare the Graph ADT with other ADTs
## Define basic notions associated with graphs
## Write classes in Java to implement graphs
## Implement graphs in Java using an adjacency matrix representation and an adjacency list representation
## Describe advantages and disadvantages of adjacency list and adjacency matrix representations.
## Implement a method to find the neighbors of a vertex in two ways.
## Evaluate the performance of this method based on the representation.
